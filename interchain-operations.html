diagram_alt_text: "A diagram illustrating the Interchain Operations practice area. Arrows extend from 'Interchain Operations' to several related areas, including 'Chains Launched' (25+), 'Chain Upgrades' (70+), 'Validators Served' (350+), and 'Game Days' (100+). The diagram is set against a vibrant purple background, with bold typography emphasizing the key metrics. The word 'HYPHA' is prominently displayed at the bottom."

tagline: "Decentralized networks are complex in multiple ways. Bleeding edge technology meets a diverse group of people spread across time zones, skill levels, and life experiences. From our technical knowledge of chain operations to organizing the people behind the nodes, we are industry leading experts in deploying, testing, and operating Cosmos SDK-based blockchains."

  - title: Testnets
    description:
      - "We operate testnets that have proven crucial for blockchain projects securing billions in assets. Our custom-built monitoring and launch tools provide insights into network behaviour and participation, enabling us to track and deliver the outcomes our development partners require. Our programs consistently achieve high engagement from node operators and users, creating an environment that surfaces critical issues before mainnet deployment. These testnet environments serve as platforms for product and technical research, allowing projects to validate their assumptions and refine their approaches in a controlled setting."
  - title: Technical Program Management
    description:
      - "We craft long- and short-term programs to help development teams take new features and technologies to market alongside operators with diverse skill levels. We have years of experience supporting and guiding multiple dev teams, validators, and node operators through complicated, risky manoeuvres on both testnets and production chains with a huge number of moving parts. From coordinating incident responses to building validator sets, managing network upgrades, or providing technical education to network participants, we create programs that keep networks humming. We understand that technical events often bring surprises, so we maintain the flexibility to adapt swiftly to changing circumstances."
      - "Our impact extends beyond immediate program management â€“ we consistently produce comprehensive technical documentation, experience reports, and other resources that contribute to the growing knowledge base of project ecosystems."
  - title: Product Delivery
    description:
      - "We ensure successful product delivery for select partners in and adjacent to the Cosmos ecosystem. Our involvement spans the entire development lifecycle, from early-stage consultation and requirements gathering to full product realization. We offer expertise in MVP development, iterative software development, product roadmap creation, user feedback integration, and day-to-day project management. Our aim is to always deliver products that are well tested, are a delight to use and operate, and not only meet current needs but are positioned for future growth."
