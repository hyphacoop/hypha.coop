We're excited to support the first [DWeb Local First weekend](https://lu.ma/2ul5uwdl), a community-driven event in Vancouver, BC focused on exploring and advancing local-first software technologies. This two-day gathering, coming up on January 11-12, 2025, brings together developers, technologists, and DWeb enthusiasts to learn about and work with the principles and applications of local-first software.  

The event will kick off with presentations from experienced LoFi practitioners including [Peter Van Hardenberg](https://www.pvh.ca/) (ü¶ã [@pvh.ca](https://bsky.app/profile/pvh.ca) \| üêò [@pvh@merveilles.town](https://merveilles.town/@pvh) ) discussing local-first software fundamentals, [Brooklyn Zelenka](https://notes.brooklynzelenka.com/) (ü¶ã [@expede.wtf](https://bsky.app/profile/expede.wtf) \| üêò [@expede@types.pl](https://types.pl/@expede)) exploring trust and security in local-first systems, and [David Luecke](https://github.com/daffl) (ü¶ã [@daffl.me](https://bsky.app/profile/daffl.me) \| üêò [@daffl@cosocial.ca](https://cosocial.ca/@daffl)) sharing insights on building real-time applications without cloud dependence.


Following the talks there will be time for attendees to connect, share ideas, and foster collaborations within the DWeb and local-first communities. Participants will have the opportunity to hack on projects together and share their collaborations.

## What is LoFi software?

Local-first software represents an alternative approach to app development focusing on:

- Giving users ownership and control of their data
- Enabling offline functionality and improved performance
- Enhancing privacy and security
- Reducing reliance on the cloud

This approach aligns with Hypha's mission of empowering communities through accessible and sustainable technology solutions. To learn more about local-first read [the foundational essay from the Ink & Switch research lab](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/?ref=dwebyvr.org).

## Hypha and local-First

As a supporter of this event, Hypha continues its commitment to supporting decentralized web technologies and community-driven innovation in developing new technology that prioritizes user agency. Local-first is just one of the tools that Hypha has promoted since the movement began. Hypha worker-owner Mauve Signweaver gave a talk at Causal Islands 2023: [Holistic Local First Software On The P2P Web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exMYxhh5t24&list=PLDiFPpmwGrtb-Dik-jZLyA9_NIEeRnPcZ&index=4) ([Slides](https://blog.mauve.moe/slides/holistic-local-first/#1))

Mauve also gave [a talk on p2p protocols](https://youtu.be/gHrul4jEHvs?si=gKgj0QOr8Bvkl8vn) a few years back that is still highly relevant.

We're also exploring and experimenting with local-first first AI as a secure and privacy-preserving alternative to the current Big Tech-backed alternatives available on the market today. More details on this in the new year.
