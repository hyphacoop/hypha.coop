### {{ page.excerpt }}

“Technology” is often followed by the word “consumption” these days. It’s come to represent a one-way relationship, not a place to create. A broadcast, not a meaningful dialogue. But tech doesn’t have to only mean tracking, algorithms, and endless scrolling. Tools and practices like blockchain, peer-to-peer, open source, and decentralized governance are putting power back into the hands of the people that use it — so they might be more than users, but instead shapers of it. We at Hypha Worker Co-operative believe building tech that’s community-driven makes for richer futures and we’re dedicated to helping communities leverage it.

### Announcing: Hypha’s newest practice area, Co-Creation Lab
Today we’re announcing Hypha’s newest practice area, Co-Creation Lab, which exists to help community-oriented arts, culture, and activist organizations explore and use tech’s potential to the fullest, on their terms. Co-Creation Lab gives projects like the ones Hypha’s already done for years with clients and collaborators including HEK (House of Electronic Arts), Furtherfield, and MEDLab a formal home.

Like Hypha’s other practice areas, Co-Creation Lab will provide embedded, end-to-end partnership across the entire tech development lifecycle, from discovery and design to ongoing management.

### Friendlier tech through co-creation, not extraction
To us, technology on fairer terms starts with our belief that how something’s made is just as important as the thing itself. Hypha is incorporated as a worker co-operative, meaning we operate as a democracy. When we say we work collaboratively with our clients, we mean it — cooperation is in our DNA. We center our projects around our clients’ needs, not ours. We’re a non-profit, so we aren’t motivated by pure profit or the use of any particular technology. What does motivate us? Sharing our clients’ goals as artists, activists, policymakers, and archivists.

### Tech that fosters access, autonomy, and sustainability

<span class="f3 accent b">Access</span> Technology has long been making it easier to access information and connection. But COVID brought new urgency to providing digital experiences and raised everyone’s bar for what they expect out of them. While cultural, arts, and activist organizations have been working to provide these new experiences, they’ve been facing access issues of their own — to the developer talent necessary to make their creative visions a reality and to get them done right at an affordable price. Co-Creation Lab is meeting this demand with an approach that teases out what clients really need while educating them throughout the process. 

<span class="f3 accent b">Autonomy</span> We believe that software should serve, even enhance or extend, our clients’ ends. On top of that, we believe that their code should belong to them, give them control, and stay well-functioning for a long time. Often, organizations have to give up ownership to make their digital projects come to life. But using technology that can be permanently altered or taken down by a third party, or whose data is vulnerable to being misused, shouldn’t be accepted as the cost of doing business. Co-Creation Lab’s team features industry-leading expertise on the peer-to-peer and decentralized technologies that dramatically limit these risks.  

<span class="f3 accent b">Sustainability</span> So much of today’s technology can be short-lived, with products and projects disappearing overnight. A lot of our work is experimental, done for boundary-pushing organizations, so it doesn’t need it to last forever to be considered a success. But the end of client tech projects should be up to our clients — not because it’s no longer working or they ran out of the resources to support it. For everything we build, maintenance and affordability are top priorities.

Beyond being a fantasy, necessary evil, or outright enemy, technology can be a valuable tool for connection and positive change. But the way it’s made must be more inclusive and informed: no small feat. Co-Creation Lab was started to tackle this challenge. We aim to show the organizations whose work we admire most that tech can be empowering — helping them reach more people in deeper ways, reliably and for generations to come.
