## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- [**Tachyons.**][tachyons] Tachyons is a functional CSS library.
- [**Jekyll.**][jekyll] A static website generator.
- [**GitHub Actions**.][gh-actions] GitHub CI automation.
- [**HTMLProofer.**][html-proofer] HTMLProofer is a set of tests to validate your HTML output.

## üíª Development

1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/hyphacoop/hypha.coop.git && cd hypha.coop`
2. Install Bundler gem: `gem install bundler`
3. Install dependancies: `bundle install`
4. Run locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Visit your `localhost` on port `4000`: http://localhost:4000 or http://127.0.0.1:4000

## üöÄ Deployment

We auto-deploy `master` branch to [hypha.coop][website] and to the decentralized web with the [Distributed Press][distributed-press]. (See [`deploy.yml`][actions-conf] for how we use GitHub Actions to auto-deploy.)

We use HTMLProofer to check the HTML output, however it will also fail on links that no longer exist, require a login, or are on the dweb. 

For links that no longer exist we update that link to an archived copy on [archive.org](https://archive.org), for links that require a login, such as LinkedIn, and those on the dweb, such as content on IPFS and Hypercore, we add `data-proofer-ignore` inside the `<a>` tag to have HTMLProofer ignore checks to that link.

## üöß Staging

We also auto-deploy `staging` branch to [staging.hypha.coop](https://staging.hypha.coop) on our staging server via GitHub Actions to test before commiting to `master` branch. 

Staging uses Let's Encrypt staging enviroment to allow for higher limits than their production environment. This allow us to redeploy sites on staging without hitting the limit of Let's Encrypt production. As a result when accessing staging you will be prompted about invalid certificate on your browser. More information on Let's Encrypt staging enviroment [here.](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/)
