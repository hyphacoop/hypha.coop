  - title: Technical advisory & strategic planning
    description:
      - "Our team members who work as executives and engineering leaders in client organizations are best positioned to advise on your data provenance strategies. With extensive experience applying appropriate cryptographic methods across artificial intelligence, data archiving, human rights, journalism, law, media, pharmaceutical, our team draws from a broad knowledge base of real-world implementations to help inform your organizational strategy."
  - title: Software product & feature delivery
    description:
      - "Although we support technical projects at all stages, our team specializes in design & development of new products and features. Whether your organization is a startup building a novel greenfield solution or operator of a production system seeking to prototype a new feature, we are ready to help!"
      - "To operate effectively in fast-paced innovation work, we rely on the team's combined expertise in applied cryptography, traditional & peer-to-peer networking, security practices & infrastructure management, as well as fluency with all common programming languages & the relevant web standards."
      - "Here are some things we've built:"
    list:
      - <strong>Digital asset authentication</strong> with C2PA and W3C Verifiable Credentials & Decentralized Identifiers
      - <strong>Verifiable computing</strong> solutions based on hardware attestations and zero-knowledge proofs
      - <strong>Decentralized preservation</strong> of private and public data with selective disclosure and other advanced requirements
      - <strong>Rapid prototyping & development</strong> of authenticated databases, data archiving systems, and verifiable AI supply chain
      - <strong>Asset registries and smart contracts</strong> on Ethereum and EVM-compatible ledgers, Cosmos CosmWasm ledgers, Hedera hashgraph, Filecoin FVM, and many other Web3 networks
  - title: Fractional engineering leadership
    description:
      - "Projects we engage with are oftentimes context heavy and technically complex from product vision to implementation. We can work embedded in your organization in engineering leadership positions, whether that means to manage the entire technical operation or to work alongside your existing engineering team. Our engineering leaders are experienced in bootstrapping from scratch and managing long-running technical operations, including staffing key roles for data provenance projects, representing your organization with vendors and other stakeholders, and providing support to fundraising and product demo activities."
      - "Whether you are venturing into an unfamiliar product category or seeking an engineering partner to build out your product vision, if it involves digital authenticity or verifiable workflows, we can help accelerate your technical plan."
